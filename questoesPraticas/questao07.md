# Question 07

### In this question, the task is to activate an LED with different brightness intensities, changing this intensity at runtime. We have a frequency of 100Hz, which means the period is equal to 0.01s or 10,000Âµs.
#####
### Through a loop, we manipulated it so that, initially, the low logical level (LED on) was 0/10,000, and we incremented it until the opposite situation occurred, 10,000/0. This caused the LED to be fully lit, and after that, we created a loop with the opposite logic to turn off the LED, making the system into a cycle.
